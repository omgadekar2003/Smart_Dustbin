# ♻️ Smart Dustbin Using Arduino

An **Automatic Touchless Smart Dustbin** that detects a person, opens automatically, identifies waste type (Wet/Dry), and segregates it using sensors and servo motors.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

This project is designed to improve hygiene and promote proper waste segregation.

The Smart Dustbin:

* Detects a person using an Ultrasonic Sensor
* Opens the lid automatically
* Detects moisture in garbage
* Classifies waste as Wet or Dry
* Separates waste using a servo-based selector mechanism

It is a cost-effective and practical solution for smart waste management systems.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

### 1️⃣ Object Detection

The ultrasonic sensor detects if a person is within 30 cm of the dustbin.
If detected, the lid opens automatically using a servo motor.

### 2️⃣ Waste Placement

The system waits for 3 seconds to allow the user to place garbage.

### 3️⃣ Moisture Detection

The moisture sensor reads analog values (0–1023).
These values are converted into percentage (0–100%).

### 4️⃣ Waste Classification

* Moisture < 40% → Wet Waste
* Moisture ≥ 40% → Dry Waste

### 5️⃣ Waste Segregation

The selector servo rotates to:

* Wet compartment
* Dry compartment

After 3 seconds, it returns to center position.

### 6️⃣ Auto Reset

When the person moves away (>30 cm), the lid closes automatically.

## 🧠 Code Logic

* Distance measured using `pulseIn()`
* Moisture value read using `analogRead()`
* Percentage calculated using `map()`
* Servo positions controlled using `.write()`
* `processDone` flag prevents repeated triggering
